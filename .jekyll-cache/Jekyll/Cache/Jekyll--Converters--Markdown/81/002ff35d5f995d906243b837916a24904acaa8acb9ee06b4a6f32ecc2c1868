I"@<p>This study compares a weight loss diet with high caloric intake during breakfast to an isocaloric diet with high caloric intake at dinner. The BF group showed greater weight loss and waist circumference reduction. Although fasting
glucose, insulin, and ghrelin were reduced in both groups, fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR decreased significantly to a greater extent in the BF group. The study concludes that high-calorie breakfast with reduced intake at dinner is beneficial and might be a useful
alternative for the management of obesity and metabolic syndrome.</p>
