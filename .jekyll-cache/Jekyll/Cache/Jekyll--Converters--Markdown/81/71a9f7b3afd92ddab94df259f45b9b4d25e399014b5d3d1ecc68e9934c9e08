I"k<p>There is sufficient research to suggest that a ketogenic diet is perfectly safe for most individuals. The reduction of carbohydrate intake to levels that induce ketosis can lead to significant benefits in blood sugar levels and lipid profiles and as a consequence reduce insulin resistance and the risks of metabolic syndrome.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is overwhelming evidence that indicates that obesity is strongly correlated to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome, ultimately being a risk factor for heart disease, stroke, cancer, degenerative neurological illnesses, among other conditions.</p>

<p>The potential therapeutic roles of ketogenic diets have been widely investigated and strong evidence support its effectiveness in weight-loss and diabetes type II control â€“ signs and symptoms of insulin resistance improve and often disappear; protection and improvement of symptoms linked to polycystic ovary syndrome, some neurological diseases, cancer, respiratory and cardiovascular illness.</p>

<p>Although exciting findings about the keto diet have been presented by reputable research boards, in the literature, there is still not unanimous concordance  about its particular mechanisms and safety. However, what is evident is the dangerous levels of obesity we now face possibly linked to  the inefficiency associated with the current nutritional guidelines.</p>
