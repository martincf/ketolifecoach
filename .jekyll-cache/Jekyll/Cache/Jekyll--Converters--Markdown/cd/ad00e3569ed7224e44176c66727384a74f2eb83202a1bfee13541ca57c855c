I"Z<p>There is sufficient research to suggest that a ketogenic diet is perfectly safe for most individuals, leading to improvement of bio-markers correlated to good health. The reduction of carbohydrate intake to levels that induce ketosis can lead to significant benefits in blood sugar levels and lipid profiles and as a consequence reduce insulin resistance and the risks of metabolic syndrome.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is overwhelming evidence that indicates that obesity is a risk factor for heart disease, stroke, cancer, and degenerative neurological illnesses.</p>

What seems evident is the danger of obesity to health.</p>
