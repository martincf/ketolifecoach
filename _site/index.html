          <h2>What is keto?</h2>
          <p>Keto is a diet that works for everybody, following a very simple protocol. A ketogenic diet is not new, it is not a fad diet,  and it is not expensive. It is a sustainable,  and delightful way of eating that your body will love.</p>
          <p>The diet works by forcing your body to use  fat instead of ingested carbohydrates for fuel. In a nutshell, you will be loosing weight rapidly, with no hunger and you will feel great long-term benefits in a sustainable way.</p>
          <p>On top, the byproduct of burning fats are ketones, which are a great source of energy for your brain.</p>

          <h3 class="moreinfo-list-item--title">Why are we becoming obese?</h3>
          <p class="moreinfo-list-item--desc"><p>Simply put because we have lost track of the pleasure and nutrition a meal can  really provide. Sometimes, we eat absent-mindedly. With help and little effort you can break this cycle.  And you won’t miss a bit the inflammation processed and refined  foods can provide.</p>

<p>We get hungry when we are malnourished -and most obese people are; when we are thirsty; when we don’t receive the bodies signalling of satiety. Sometimes we eat for comfort, to improve our mood, because we all want to keep smiling and we all want to be happy.</p>

<p>We eat at special occasions to celebrate life too. Once you embrace a ketogenic life-style you won’t need to restrain yourself from food, constantly worrying about portion sizes. You will know about better choices, you will  know how your body works and take ownership of  every aspect of your health.</p>

          <p class="moreinfo-list-item--desc"><p>Keto is an incredible  tool to help you regain control of your weight and your blood sugar levels.  By simply changing your eating habits your body will access fat for fuel.</p>

<p>You will learn how to block the constant hunger and to stop the perpetual flow of carbohydrates which triggers monumental levels of insulin. When the body becomes a fat burning machine it produces ketones. The more fat adapted we become the higher  the levels of ketones, the lower the levels of insulin.</p>

<p>There are several ways to measure your ketones levels. You can verify ketosis with different methods but the magic is when you can teach your body to deliver ketones at will, effortless. The signs will be clear:  less hunger, weight loss, and more energy.</p>

          <p class="moreinfo-list-item--desc"><p>Inflammation is the main indicator of disease in the body, meaning that the more inflamed we are  (and continue to be) the poorer are our health outcomes.</p>

<p>A ketogenic diet reduces this inflammatory process by the replacing the sugars and carbohydrates of your diet, with nutrient rich alternatives.</p>

<p>Ketones have anti-inflammatory properties on itself. By taking simple steps in the choice and preparation of your food you can influence your health markers.</p>

<p>By learning how to address possible deleterious exposures and contributory factor to poor health you will be able to tackle what matters most, your well-being and longevity.</p>
