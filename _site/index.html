          <h2>What is keto?</h2>
          <p>Keto is a diet that works for everybody, following a very simple protocol. A ketogenic diet is not new, it is not a fad diet,  and it is not expensive. It is a sustainable,  and delightful way of eating that your body will love.</p>
          <p>The diet works by forcing your body to use  fat instead of ingested carbohydrates for fuel. In a nutshell, you will be loosing weight rapidly, with no hunger and you will feel great long-term benefits in a sustainable way.</p>
          <p>On top, the byproduct of burning fats are ketones, which are a great source of energy for your brain.</p>

          <p class="research-list-item--desc">Recent work over the last decade or so has provided evidence of the therapeutic potential of ketogenic diets in many pathological conditions, such as diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, acne, neurological diseases, cancer and the amelioration of respiratory and cardiovascular disease risk factors. The possibility that modifying food intake can be useful for reducing or eliminating pharmaceutical methods of treatment, which are often lifelong with significant side effects, calls for serious investigation
