  <h3 class="research-list-item--title">Keto during COVID-19</h3>
  <div class="research-list-item--content"><h2 id="covid-positive-uk----2021">Covid-Positive UK  - 2021</h2>

<p>Adversity brings change. We can change the way we look at things. We have been given a massive boost in a currency we barely recognise: time!</p>

<p>Take this offer with due respect. Now is the moment to breath deeply (through a mask) and to help those in need, because time is indeed a gift when you do not have much of it to spare.</p>

<p>We can start by helping front-line caregivers by remaining physically active and looking after ourselves through the food we eat.</p>

<p>Humans are capable of doing amazing things. We can re-learn how we once ate and how food has brought happiness for thousands of years. We were doing so well until approximately two generations ago. We were mostly lean and healthy, and ate like lions, to satiety and not to capacity. We ate nutritious foods. And when food was available, it was a wonderful time.</p>

<p>But there is something not right about the way we relate to food now. Ask yourself when was the last time you’ve felt wonderful after a meal. If the feeling is not happening very often (or at all), I am afraid to say that it is likely that we are doing (eating) something wrong.</p>

<p>Food that is right is food that is fuel. It makes us nourished, fulfilled, happy and calm for hours.</p>

<p>We can make better choices about the foods we eat, for example. Highly processed foods in the form of cakes, pizzas, donuts, sweets, and takeaways are very harmful to our health and well-being. Consuming these products at a time of crisis (personal or national) can indeed be both harmful and addictive!</p>

<p>Better times always come. But still, ingesting sugars and highly processed foods at ‘a time of plenty’ may also not be the treat we expect in the long run. Instead, it can turn into a delayed punishment which will take the form of weight gain and poor health outcomes.</p>

<p>We can surely do without the convenience of ready- made foods. It takes being watchful of what we buy. Fresh single item ingredients when put together a meal can make up great dishes.
Watch out for the convenience of ready made meals disguised as food, as they tend to come back to bite you. I am not sure how the word ‘convenient’ came to be applied in the context of feeding ourselves poorly, but it has happened. And the danger is that it can get worse.</p>

<p>So here is a way to really help your country and your community at this difficult time. Do not delegate your health to doctors already overwhelmed. Be that superhero to your family, your friends and fellow citizens – look after what you eat.</p>

    <h3 class="research-list-item--title">Beyond weight loss: a review of the therapeutic uses of very-low-carbohydrate (ketogenic) diets</h3>
    <div class="research-list-item--desc"><p>Recent work over the last decade or so has provided evidence of the therapeutic potential of ketogenic diets in many pathological conditions, such as diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, acne, neurological diseases, cancer and the amelioration of respiratory and cardiovascular disease risk factors. The possibility that modifying food intake can be useful for reducing or eliminating pharmaceutical methods of treatment, which are often lifelong with significant side effects, calls for serious investigation</p>

    <h3 class="research-list-item--title">The ketogenic diet: pros and cons</h3>
    <div class="research-list-item--desc"><p>The ketogenic diet causes a rapid and sensible weight loss along with favourable biomarker changes, such as a reduction in serum hemoglobin A1c in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2. However, it also causes a substantial rise in low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and many physicians are therefore hesitant to endorse it. In view of the popular uptake of the keto diet even among subjects not in need of weight loss, there is some preoccupation with the potential long-term consequences of a wide embrace of this diet by large segments of the population.</p>

    <h3 class="research-list-item--title">Therapeutic use of intermittent fasting for people with type 2 diabetes as an alternative to insulin</h3>
    <div class="research-list-item--desc"><p>Although lifestyle modifications are universally acknowledged to be the first-line treatment of T2D, adequate glycaemic control is difficult to achieve in majority of obese patients. Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment option for obese patients with T2D, but is invasive, costly and not without its risks. Long-term effects have not been definitively established, and failure of the surgical intervention may occur due to non-compliance with diet and lifestyle factors. In addition, many patients require surgical reversal. Medications help manage the symptoms of diabetes, but they cannot prevent the progression of the disease. Therapeutic fasting has the potential to fill this gap in diabetes care by providing similar intensive caloric restriction and hormonal benefits as bariatric surgery without the invasive surgery.</p>

    <div class="research-list-item--desc"><p>Ten patients with type 1 diabetes and diabetic gastroparesis, including one patient who had undergone vagotomy, were included and completed the investigator blinded crossover trial. The gastric emptying rate (GER) was measured using standardized real-time ultrasonography. The GER was calculated as the percentage change in the antral cross-sectional area 15 and 90 minutes after ingestion of 300 g rice pudding and 200 ml water (GER1), or 300 g rice pudding and 200 ml water with 30 ml apple cider vinegar (GER2). The subjects drank 200 ml water daily before breakfast one week before the measurement of GER1. The same subjects drank 200 ml water with 30 ml vinegar daily before breakfast for two weeks before the measurement of GER2.</p>

    <h3 class="research-list-item--title">Effect of cinnamon on postprandial blood glucose, gastric emptying, and satiety in healthy subjects.</h3>
    <div class="research-list-item--desc"><p>The gastric emptying rate (GER) was measured by using standardized real-time ultrasonography. Fourteen healthy subjects were assessed by using a crossover trial. The subjects were examined after an 8-h fast if they had normal fasting blood glucose concentrations. GER was calculated as the percentage change in the antral cross-sectional area 15-90 min after ingestion of 300 g rice pudding (GER1) or 300 g rice pudding and 6 g cinnamon (GER2).
The median value of GER1 was 37%, and that of GER2 was 34.5%. The addition of cinnamon to the rice pudding significantly delayed gastric emptying and lowered the postprandial glucose response (P &lt; 0.05 for both). The reduction in the postprandial blood glucose concentration was much more noticeable and pronounced than was the lowering of the GER. The effect of cinnamon on satiety was not significant.</p>

    <div class="research-list-item--desc"><p>Eleven subjects with DM2 consumed vinegar or placebo (at random order on two separate days, a week apart), before a mixed meal. Plasma glucose, insulin, triglycerides, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), and glycerol were measured preprandially and at 30-60 min for 300 min postprandially from the radial artery and from a forearm vein. Muscle blood flow was measured with strain-gauge plethysmography. Glucose uptake was calculated as the arteriovenous difference of glucose multiplied by blood flow.</p>

    <div class="research-list-item--desc"><p>This study compares a weight loss diet with high caloric intake during breakfast to an isocaloric diet with high caloric intake at dinner. The BF group showed greater weight loss and waist circumference reduction. Although fasting
glucose, insulin, and ghrelin were reduced in both groups, fasting glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR decreased significantly to a greater extent in the BF group. The study concludes that high-calorie breakfast with reduced intake at dinner is beneficial and might be a useful
alternative for the management of obesity and metabolic syndrome.</p>
