      <h2>What is keto?</h2>
      <p>Keto is a diet that works for everybody, following a very simple protocol. A ketogenic diet is not new, it is not a fad diet,  and it is not expensive. It is a sustainable,  and delightful way of eating that your body will love.</p>
      <p>The diet works by forcing your body to use  fat instead of ingested carbohydrates for fuel. In a nutshell, you will be loosing weight rapidly, with no hunger and you will feel great long-term benefits in a sustainable way.</p>
      <p>On top, the byproduct of burning fats are ketones, which are a great source of energy for your brain.</p>
