## Covid-Positive UK  - 2021

Adversity brings change. We can change the way we look at things. We have been given a massive boost in a currency we barely recognise: time!

Take this offer with due respect. Now is the moment to breath deeply (through a mask) and to help those in need, because time is indeed a gift when you do not have much of it to spare.

We can start by helping front-line caregivers by remaining physically active and looking after ourselves through the food we eat.

Humans are capable of doing amazing things. We can re-learn how we once ate and how food has brought happiness for thousands of years. We were doing so well until approximately two generations ago. We were mostly lean and healthy, and ate like lions, to satiety and not to capacity. We ate nutritious foods. And when food was available, it was a wonderful time.

But there is something not right about the way we relate to food now. Ask yourself when was the last time you’ve felt wonderful after a meal. If the feeling is not happening very often (or at all), I am afraid to say that it is likely that we are doing (eating) something wrong.

Food that is right is food that is fuel. It makes us nourished, fulfilled, happy and calm for hours.

We can make better choices about the foods we eat, for example. Highly processed foods in the form of cakes, pizzas, donuts, sweets, and takeaways are very harmful to our health and well-being. Consuming these products at a time of crisis (personal or national) can indeed be both harmful and addictive!

Better times always come. But still, ingesting sugars and highly processed foods at 'a time of plenty' may also not be the treat we expect in the long run. Instead, it can turn into a delayed punishment which will take the form of weight gain and poor health outcomes.

We can surely do without the convenience of ready- made foods. It takes being watchful of what we buy. Fresh single item ingredients when put together can make up great dishes.
Watch out for the convenience of ready made meals disguised as food, as they tend to come back to bite you. I am not sure how the word ‘convenient' came to be applied in the context of feeding ourselves poorly, but it has happened. And the danger is that it can get worse.

So here is a way to really help your country and your community at this difficult time. Do not delegate your health to doctors already overwhelmed. Be that superhero to your family, your friends and fellow citizens – look after what you eat.
